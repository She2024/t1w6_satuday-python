# If-Else Practice Acitivity

## Building a calculator
Build a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 inputs as numbers(floats) for operation and 3rd input to decide which operation they want to perform

# Lists
Composite Data Type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable.
Each piece is called an element.

# Loops

Runing in circles
Used to repeat a block of code mulitple times until a certain condition is met. 

DRY Coiding Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

Example: Counting coind in your piggy bank

"If" conditions decide whether or not to run the intended block. 
"Loops" decide how many times to run the intended block. 

# While loop
While the condition is met, keep executing the intended block. If not met, skip the block.

## Range
It's a pre-defined function that generates a sequence of numbers.

Useful: Loops for iterating a specific number of times over a sequence of numbers.

range(start, stop,step)

## For Loop
For each item in a sequence, execute the intended statements. (counting cannot work with float only whole numbers)

for variable_name in sequence:
    stmts

## Practice Example 1
Finding the sum of the first ten numbers (1, 2, ... 10)     

## Practice Example 1
Finding the largest number in the list
list = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]
