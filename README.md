# If-Else Practice Acitivity

## Building a calculator
Build a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 inputs as numbers(floats) for operation and 3rd input to decide which operation they want to perform

# Lists
Composite Data Type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable.
Each piece is called an element.

# Loops

Runing in circles
Used to repeat a block of code mulitple times until a certain condition is met. 

DRY Coiding Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

Example: Counting coind in your piggy bank

"If" conditions decide whether or not to run the intended block. 
"Loops" decide how many times to run the intended block. 

# While loop
While the condition is met, keep executing the intended block. If not met, skip the block.
