# Pseudocode
Plain language description of the steps in an algorithim or program.
Bridge between the program's logic and the actual code. 

## Importancce
Helps to understnad and plan the program logic so it's easier to code.
Improves colaboration in team projects.
Helps with troubleshooting.
Identify the core areas of the programing that needs to be done. 

## Characterisitics
Plain language: Simple and understandable
Structures: follows a logical programable sequence ( in plain english)
Absracted Focuses on logic more than syntacx
Deatiled: More details - through walk through that helps explain the logic.

## Basic constructs

- Sequential 
'''

    Step 1: do this 
    Step 2: do that
'''

- Conditional:

'''
    IF condition matches THEN
     Do something
    ELSE
        Do somtheing else
    END IF
'''    

- Loops
'''
    WHILE condition meets 
        Do something
    END WHILE
'''

'''
    FOR EACH item in collection 
        DO something
    END FOR
'''

## Practical Examples

- Example 1 : Calculating the sum of a list of numbers
'''
    Initialise sum to 0
    FOR each number in the list 
        ADD the number to sum
    END FOR
    Print sum
'''
- Example 2: Finding the maximum number in a list

'''
    Initialise mas to the first numer of the list
    FOR each number in the list
        IF number is greater than max THEM
            SET max to number
        END IF
    END FOR
    Print max
